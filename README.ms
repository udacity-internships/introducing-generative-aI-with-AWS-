# Generative AI with AWS - Nanodegree Project Repository



## 🎉 About This Course

This repository contains all the materials, projects, and notes from the **"Introducing Generative AI with AWS"** course. The program provided a comprehensive journey from AI fundamentals to real-world implementation using AWS services.  

Through hands-on projects and exercises, I gained practical experience in building, fine-tuning, and deploying generative AI models.
